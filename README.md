# PADE-PLUS

This is an extension to the original PADE project. It is intended to provide a more flexible interface, abstracting formalisms brought by FIPA standards (such as Interaction protocols) and presenting tools that reduce language verbosity.

It is also a trampoline for ideas that may eventually be suggested as pull request for the original project.

Please support the [official release](https://github.com/grei-ufc/pade)!
